In this project I use the dataset is https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv

To run the opencv files and pandas files we need a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment in windows terminal

The command is --> 'py -m venv .env'

The above command creates a virtual environment

After that update pip --> 'pip3 install --upgrade'

To run the opencv file we need a library that library name is 'opencv-python' to import that library --> 'pip3 install opencv-python'

To run the pandas file we need a library that library name is 'pandas' to import that library --> 'pip3 install pandas'
